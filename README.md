A WordPress theme for [MIP](https://github.com/mipengine/mip).

2022 年 9 月 27 日，百度资源平台发布《MIP 服务下线通知》：

```text
亲爱的开发者，

随着移动生态技术的发展，网站自身能力逐渐完善，无需通过 MIP 技术优化。因此，百度搜索将于 10 月下线 MIP 服务。搜索结果中展现的 MIP 资源 URL 会自动回退为适配前的 URL。非常感谢您一直以来对百度搜索的关心和支持！

若存在其他疑问可以通过反馈中心咨询，将会有相关同学跟进回复。
```

On September 27, 2022, Baidu Resource Platform released the "MIP Service Shutdown Notice":

```
Dear developers,

With the development of mobile ecological technology, the capabilities of websites themselves are gradually improving, and there is no need to optimize through MIP technology. Therefore, Baidu Search will shut down the MIP service in October. The MIP resource URLs displayed in the search results will automatically revert to the URLs before adaptation. Thank you very much for your concern and support for Baidu Search all the time!

If you have any other questions, you can consult the feedback center, and relevant colleagues will follow up and reply.
```

## Notice

Dear users,

I regret to inform you that I will no longer be able to support the Mazey MIP WordPress theme due to the official shutdown of the MIP service by Baidu. As you may know, Baidu Resource Platform has announced that they will shut down the MIP service in October 2022. This means that the MIP resource URLs displayed in the search results will automatically revert to the URLs before adaptation.

As a result, the Mazey MIP WordPress theme will no longer be necessary for optimizing websites through MIP technology. I understand that this may be disappointing news for those who have been using the theme and relying on its features. However, I am unable to continue supporting the theme as it will no longer be relevant or necessary.

I want to thank you for your support and interest in the Mazey MIP WordPress theme. It has been a pleasure to work on this project and to see it being used by many users. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me. I will do my best to assist you in any way I can.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Mazey
